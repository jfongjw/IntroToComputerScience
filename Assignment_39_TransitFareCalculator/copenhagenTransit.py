     Takes as two parameters: the zone and the ticket type.
     Returns the Copenhagen Transit fare, as follows:

     If the zone is 2 or smaller and the ticket type is "adult", the fare is 23.
     If the zone is 2 or smaller and the ticket type is "child", the fare is 11.5.
     If the zone is 3 and the ticket type is "adult", the fare is 34.5.
     If the zone is 3 or 4 and the ticket type is "child", the fare is 23.
     If the zone is 4 and the ticket type is "adult", the fare is 46.
     If the zone is greater than 4, return a negative number (since your calculator does not handle inputs that high).
